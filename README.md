# Prediction of COVID-19 using Chest X-ray Images (Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) 🦠🔍📊

This project focuses on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict whether patients are infected with COVID-19 based on their chest X-ray images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to contribute to early detection and diagnosis of COVID-19, a critical need during the ongoing pandemic.

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we accomplished the following:

- Built and trained a CNN from scratch using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend.
- Utilized Matplotlib for data visualization to gain insights from the X-ray images.
- Performed data preprocessing and augmentation using TensorFlow 2.0 to enhance model performance.
- Designed a sequential model architecture, incorporating convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, dense layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation.
- Employed a labeled dataset containing chest X-ray images of both non-COVID and COVID-19 infected patients, obtained from Kaggle.
- Evaluated the model using various metrics, including training set accuracy, validation set accuracy, and test set accuracy.
- Employed the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 for efficient gradient descent.
- Conducted the entire project within the Google Colab environment for seamless development and execution.

## 📈 Model Performance

The CNN model yielded the following impressive results:

- **Training Set Accuracy**: 97.38%
- **Training Set Loss**: 0.0875

- **Validation Set Accuracy**: 97.79%
- **Validation Set Loss**: 0.0744

- **Test Set Accuracy**: 98.14%
- **Test Set Loss**: 0.06641
